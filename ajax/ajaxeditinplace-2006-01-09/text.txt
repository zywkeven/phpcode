dashing through the snow on a one-horse open sleigh, over the fields we go, laughing all the way; bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright, what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight. Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way! O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way! O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.1111111
