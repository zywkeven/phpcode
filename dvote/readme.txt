DVOTE class (PHP)

This class implements a voting management system.
All settings can be achieved from a initialization
file (in this example, 'vote.ini').

There's some flexibility in the implementation, so
one may set one's custom entries, either in global
settings.

Usually one sets up:
* the number of entries;
* the entries labels themselves;
* all votes numbers to 0.

One should see both example files index.php and
vote.php to understand how this class works.
